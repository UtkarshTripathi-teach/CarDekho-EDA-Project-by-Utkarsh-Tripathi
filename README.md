# CarDekho-EDA-Project-by-Utkarsh-Tripathi
==========================================================

Project Overview
----------------
This project explores the CarDekho dataset to uncover the key factors influencing used car prices. Through cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data, the goal is to surface actionable insights relevant to car pricing trends.

Key Components
--------------
1. Data Loading & Inspection
   - Initial overview: data types, shape, missing values, and outliers.

2. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing data.
   - Addressed outliers to improve data quality.

3. Feature Engineering
   - Transformed categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, seller type, transmission) using encoding.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visual exploration.
   - Analyzed price trends by age, brand, fuel type, mileage, and seller category.

5. Insights Extracted
   - Identified how car age, fuel type, transmission, and seller type affect resale value.
   - Observed pricing patterns and correlations across key features.

6. Learnings & Outcomes
   - Reinforced skills in data wrangling, cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
   - Built intuitive, visual dashboards to tell data-driven stories.

How to Explore
--------------
- Open the Jupyter notebook file:  
    `CarDekho Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project.ipynb`
- Follow the annotated steps from data loading through insight generation.
- Visualizations are fully rendered within the notebook for immediate interpretation.

Recommended Use Cases
----------------------
- CV or Portfolio: Demonstrates data analysis and visualization skillset.
- Learning Resource: A hands-on example of EDA for Python enthusiasts.
- Business Insights: Useful for stakeholders tracking used car market trends.
